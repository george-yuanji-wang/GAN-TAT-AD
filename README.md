# ISEF-2023-(George, Shreesh, Prince)


This is the repository and workspace for the ISEF project "RL powered robot swarm searching algorithm". Please save you code, data, notes, and everything related to the project in this repository. Different Branches are created to conduct different type of works, for example, the code to generate and save the training data shall be assigned to an independent branch. The online repository is linked to the local repository on my Mac to run Jupyter notebook, if we found a better local desktop we can switch it. Please keep this repository organised and neat. The repository is private and only people invited are able to see.
